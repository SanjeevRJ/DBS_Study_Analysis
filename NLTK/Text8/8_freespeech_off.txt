I’m really looking forward to the day when all of my body parts work like they are supposed to. And I can get out and play golf, and I can walk, and I can exercise, and I can really get back to being the person I normally am. Is that long enough? 10 seconds, one more? And I don’t have to worry about wearing any, any assistive devices, or having to use anything for balance assistance, or hanging onto walls, or anything that stops me from looking like I’m inebriated.
