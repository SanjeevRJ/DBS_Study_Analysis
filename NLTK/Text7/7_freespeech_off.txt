Well lets see. We left home about 8, got here about 9. Gonna go home, and I’m going to decorate for easter. I got a little Christmas tree, and I’m gonna put some little eggs on it, and little lights, and set it outside of my room. And then I go, probably, I don’t know if I’m gonna go on the rowing machine or not, but I’m gonna walk.
